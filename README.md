# Explainable AI in Healthcare: A Thesis Project

This repository contains the work for my thesis on integrating Explainable AI (XAI) methods into predictive process analytics for healthcare, specifically within the SurgeCon project's Emergency Department (ED).

## üìÑ Abstract

While powerful, many complex machine learning models used for making predictions essentially work as a black box, meaning they lack transparency. Explainable AI (XAI) methods can deepen the understanding of the predictions made by the models by providing insights into factors influencing the prediction outcome. The aim of this thesis is to further encourage the use of predictive process analytics in healthcare. This is achieved by designing healthcare and process-specific XAI visualizations.

The study aims to fulfill three objectives:
1. Develop predictive process analytics models for the SurgeCon project‚Äôs Emergency Department (ED) using real data.
2. Adapt XAI methods and visualizations to the healthcare and process context within SurgeCon.
3. Evaluate the understanding of adapted XAI methods through user feedback from non-technical ED staff.

This research aims to enhance the integration of predictive process analytics and XAI within healthcare, ultimately improving healthcare processes and decision-making on the level of healthcare management workers.
